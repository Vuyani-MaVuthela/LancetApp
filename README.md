I have got 3 projects in this solution

1. The C# API - which is the MedAPI
2. A node API - named image-uploader
3. React front-end app - named lancet-app
4. And a unit tests project for the C# API

All projects have readme files

Getting started

- Run npm i command on react lancet-app
- Run npm i command on node image-uploader

Testing

- Run both apis concurrently as microservices
- The MedAPI comes with a swagger UI that you can interact with to test it in isolation
- The node api can slo be tested in isolation through postman or any other api testing tool
- And also run the react app
